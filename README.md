# Back-End-Application-Intermediate

This repository is a compilation of me learning on how to improve my skill in writing backend program.
I am very proud that I am able to participate in an event from Dicoding Academy within this journey.

The reason I posted this on Github is that, I want to leave a learning mark here so in the future I can look back and see how my backend skill has improved through out the time.

For those who see this repository and have some questions, please do not hesitate to open an issue here.
